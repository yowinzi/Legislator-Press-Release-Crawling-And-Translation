Almost everyone who wants to use machine learning algorithms in practical applications will face the problem of Domain Adaptation. It means we have established a model in a  source domain, but hope to expand our model to different target domains.

In machine translation, we always train the model with some popular open datasets,e.g., WMT( Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation) or IWSLT( International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation).
