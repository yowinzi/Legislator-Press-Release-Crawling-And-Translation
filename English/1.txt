Distributable of the Labor Rights No Safeguards Wang Yimei Promotion of Labor Minister Putting: May 28, 107, Legislative Committee Wang Yimin At this time (28) Social Welfare and Environmental Health Committee, it pointed out that according to private group investigation, nearly 70% 5 Distributable salary of 20,000, but in the written report of the Ministry of Labor, only the statistics of the Standard General's number of workers were sent, but did not see the Ministry of Labor for dispatching labor or partial workers salary level. The complete information statistics, thus questioning the labor department unable to master the salary of the labor, how to solve the problem of the low salary of labor? Wang Yumin also pointed out that the current dispatch of labor salary is excessive, resulting in a low salary issue of dispatching work. There is a department store's residential powerway, which originally talked a salary of 55,000 yuan, but the employee finally got 32,000 yuan, which was equal to 60% of the dispatched company to 60%, seriously exploiting labor. Labor Minister Xu Mingchun also said when he replied that, according to her understanding of the current dispatch, there is a low salary problem, but there is no relevant specification for this. Wang Yimin emphasized that due to the dispatch of labor dispatched units and the management of the two employers who sent a double employer, the dispatch of salary was dispatched by the company to force the company to be compulsory and reduced, and there is no special to strengthen the control, leading to dispatching units. There are often violations or malicious reverberations, so that the dispatch of labor does not receive salary, but it is necessary to send a unit but do not need to be responsible. Wang Yimin believes that the Ministry of Labor shall promptly recommend the draft "Dispatch Labor Protection" to ensure the rights and interests of the labor. In this regard, the Minister of Labor Xu Mingchun has been confident, and the parties of labor have not had a consensus, and the next session will be able to send it into the legislation, fear is difficult.
